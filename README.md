Project split and moved into seperate repositories
==================================================
The ConDep repository has now been split into several other repositories located in the [ConDep Organization](https://github.com/condep/) in GitHub. This repo is now only used for sentralized issues (issues where you don't know which ConDep repo it belongs to).
